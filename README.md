# Resize image with javascript & Upload via Ajax

This script resizes image on the client browser, and it sends the resized image to SERVER. 
* Some image files taken with mobile phone device are very large (5000 pixels). The PHP Server will not allow you to proceed with this large file.

** That is why it is better to resize on the client brower, and than send the resized image to Server
